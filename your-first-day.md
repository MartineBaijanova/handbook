# Your first day

## Out location
We are on the 7th floor of a centrally located office in Amsterdam at Stadhouderskade 85. An access card to the office can be found in your HootHoot welcome kit. Simply hold it in front of the sensor and push/pull open the doors or tell the elevator that you want to go to our floor. The building is accessible at all hours of the day. However, when you wish to leave or enter outside of office hours, please note that the revolving door and area demarcated by tape will set of an alarm. Instead you can use your access card on the entrance to be found on the right of the revolving doors.

Emergency situations
In case of emergency we have two fire escapes on our floor. Please keep calm and follow instructions given.

## Where to go
On your first day we expect you to report to the security of the main desk downstairs at 9.30AM. Here you will either get a guest access card, or they will call our floor and someone will come pick you up.

## What should you bring
The most important thing for you to bring on your first day as an employee at Owlin is your laptop. Another thing we can recommend for you to bring is an open mind!

## Other infos

### WiFi
Our WiFi network is called: [something with owlin]
The password is: coffeetocode

### Email and IM
All employees have an e-mail address formatted as follows [FIRSTNAME]@owlin.com. Once you have access to your e-mail account, please add your signature. To keep in touch during the day we use Hipchat, and old-fashioned standing up and walking over to someone.

If you do not yet have an e-mail address and Hipchat invite by the time you start, please let Bart know.

### Calendar
Internally we use google calendar connected to your Owlin email address to keep track of meetings and commitments. We urge you to keep yours up to date at all times.

### Printer
At the printer there is a USB stick that you can use to upload what you want to print in pdf. Please make sure the USB stick is always put back by the printer.

### Where to park your bike
The Netherlands is famous for its bike-usage, and both our Dutch and our international employees are no exception. Many of us come to the office by bike. You can park it in the garage of the building, accessible by using your access card on the door all the way to the right when standing in front of the building. Here you can walk down with your bike and put it in the bikeracks. Don’t forget to lock it!

### Working remotely
In most instances it is very possible for you to work from home when you cannot come to the office. We are very flexible! Please discuss your wishes and the possibilities with Sjoerd.

### Lunch
We have a big company sponsored lunch together at the office. This gives you an opportunity to get to know your colleagues better and to relax for a bit.ch

### Dress Code
At our office we do not have a dress code. However, when attending external meetings, or when having meetings at our office with customers, please take notice of the expectations they may have regarding the appropriateness of your attire.

### 10-Minute rule
This rule works twofold. If you have the tendency to always figure out everything alone, it goes as follows: if you cannot get any closer to an answer after 10 minutes, you have to ask someone for help. On the other hand, if you have the tendency to ask a lot of questions: you need to search for an answer on your own for at least 10 minutes before you may ask.
