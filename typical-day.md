# Typical day at owlin

![clock](https://github.com/owlin/handbook/blob/master/owlin-clock-.png)

ARRIVE AT OFFICE & GET READY: Some of us like to start early others... not so much. Just make sure you’re here before 9.30.

TEAM STAND-UP: What are you going to do to today? Get together with your team to see who is doing what today.

BUSINESS LIKE NORMAL: Work on a project individually, get involved with clients, pair-programme, etc. And don’t forget an occasional coffee break.

LUNCH-TIME: Sit down at the table for our daily company lunch.

BUSINESS AS USUAL: Finish what you committed to do, or have those last meetings to make sure everyone is on the same track. Again, don’t forget to take small breaks every now and then.

FRIDAY DRINKS: Listen to some music while having a drink. Get to know your collegues and play a game air hockey.
