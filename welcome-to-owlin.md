We are really happy and excited that you joined Owlin.

At Owlin we aim to create transparency in the financial world by revolutionising the way online news is used, and you are a valuable addition to the team that will get us there. More importantly, we have a lot of fun while doing it.

It is really important to us that you feel at home. What we are trying to say is: don’t hesitate to call when you need something, or yell out when you have a question, idea, or concern. We are all looking forward to helping you settle in in the team.

We aim to help you grow and develop during your time at Owlin, and trust that you will help us do the same.

On behalf of all of us here at Owlin: Welcome to the family!
