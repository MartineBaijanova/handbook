Owlin is an ambitious technology company who is developing the next generation of real-time data analysis, and that’s why we need best-in-class engineering.

Founded in 2012, we have built an international team of hand picked people including Data Scientist, Business Hustlers and Designers. Instead of writing code on an island somewhere out there, you’re working on the next revolution of Big Data, products for clients like ING, Deloitte and KPMG and their end users.

We are preparing for an ambitious year ahead and that’s why we encourage you to join us!
